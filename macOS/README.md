# macOS Bootstrap
The `bootstrap_mac.sh` sets up macOS with brew packages listed in `Brewfile`

## Manual tasks
-   Install Segoe UI fonts from [https://aka.ms/SegoeFonts](https://aka.ms/SegoeFonts)

## Usage
Access the Azure Portal using a fully qualified url including AAD domain name in it e.g. `https://portal.azure.com/mybrand.onmicrosoft.com`.

## Limitations & Known Issues
- No Bash profile set up
- As macOS is not used from aVM (by me), there is less focus on automation. Hence the manual set up tasks documented above.
